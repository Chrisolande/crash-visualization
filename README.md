## Crash Visualization

**Visualization** is a powerful tool for telling a story about datasets or analysis. If done correctly, visualization not only displays data but also help the audience digest key information.

**However, bad communication is everywhere.** 

We are not ****naturally good at dealing with data or representing. We need to learn how to do it properly and how to make it better**,** just like we learn other knowledge and skills. That is my intention to write this book.

My goal is to make this book as helpful and user-friendly as possible. Currently, it is on the preview stage and I'm still working on it. Any feedback is welcome and appreciated. Contact: [ivy.w@veccoinsight.com](mailto:ivy.w@veccoinsight.com)
