**Visualization** is a powerful tool for telling a story about datasets or analysis. If done correctly, visualization not only displays data but also helps the audience digest key information. 

However, in the world we live, bad communication is everywhere. One reason is that people do not understand the data behind the graph they created. Sometimes it is intended to mislead or shock. Sometimes it is well-meaning but the audience just interprets it plain wrong. To avoid the above circumstances, no matter which field you are in, itâ€™s better to know more about visualization.

We are not ****naturally good at dealing with data or representing. We need to learn how to do it properly and how to make it better**,** just like we learn other knowledge and skills. That is my intention to write this book.

My goal is to make this book as helpful and user-friendly as possible. Currently, it is on the preview stage and I'm still working on it. Any feedback is welcome and appreciated. Contact: [ivy.w@veccoinsight.com](mailto:ivy.w@veccoinsight.com)
