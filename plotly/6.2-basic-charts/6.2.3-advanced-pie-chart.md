# 6.2.3 Advanced Pie Chart

### Pie Chart

In chapter 2, we discussed why the pie chart is easy to be messed up. Here is another example. When the observations are more than 5, the pie chart will become hard to read or deliver information. You should be very careful before using it. 

```text
df = px.data.gapminder().query("year == 2007").query("continent == 'Asia'")
df.loc[df['pop'] < 10.e6, 'country'] = 'Other countries' # Represent only large countries
fig = px.pie(df, values='pop', names='country', title='Population of Asia continent',width=800, height=400)
fig.show()
```

### Donut Chart



### Sunburst Chart

**Sunburst plots** visualize hierarchical data spanning outwards radially from root to leaves. It looks fancy and stylish, however, it could be even messer than a pie chart. Be careful!

```text
fig = px.sunburst(df, path=['continent', 'country'], values='pop',
                  color='lifeExp', hover_data=['iso_alpha'])
fig.show()
```
