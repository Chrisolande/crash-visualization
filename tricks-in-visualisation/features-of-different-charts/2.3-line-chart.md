Line charts are among the most frequently used chart types. Use lines when you have a continuous data set. These are best suited for trend-based visualizations of data over a period of time, when the number of data points is very high \(more than 20\). 

With line charts, the emphasis is on the continuation or the flow of the values \(a trend\).  The  most common use of line chart could be :

* stock market price changes over time
* website traffic period over period
* sales performance for the previous month or quarter.

### Area Chart

An area chart is essentially a line chart â€” good for trends and some comparisons. Area charts will fill up the area below the line, so the best use for this type of chart is for presenting accumulative value changes over time, like item stock, number of employees, or a savings account.
