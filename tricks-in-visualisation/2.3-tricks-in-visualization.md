# 2.3 Misleading Graph

Our brain is prewired to process visual content much quicker than text, which is why data design is so effective. By “seeing” the data, it is easier for your brain to intake, synthesize, and retain the information presented.

While graphs can be a valuable tool to help summarize data into a compelling story, they can also inadvertently be used incorrectly or worse, to mislead. This can make results appear different than they actually are and/or lead others to draw incorrect conclusions.  Here are a few typical tricks in visulization.
