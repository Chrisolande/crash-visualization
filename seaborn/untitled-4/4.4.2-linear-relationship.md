# 4.4.2 Linear Relationship

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.

A [scatterplot](4.4.1-scatter-plot.md) can be a helpful tool in determining the strength of the relationship between two variables. If there appears to be no association between the proposed explanatory and dependent variables, then fitting a linear regression model to the data probably will not provide a useful model. 

Before attempting to fit a linear model to observed data, a modeler should first determine whether or not there is a relationship between the variables of interest. This does not necessarily imply that one variable causes the other, but that there is some significant association between the two variables.

There are two main functions that can visualize a linear relationship as determined through regression. `regplot()` performs a simple linear regression model fit and plot. `lmplot()` combines `regplot()` and `FacetGrid`. Compared to the first one,`lmplot()` is more computationally intensive and is intended as a convenient interface to fit regression models across conditional subsets of a dataset.

### Regplot

```text
import seaborn as sns
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
sns.regplot(x = 'total_bill', y = 'tip',data = tips)
```

### Lmplot

```text
sns.lmplot(x="total_bill", y="tip", data=tips)
```
