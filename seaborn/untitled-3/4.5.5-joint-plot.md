# 4.5.5 Joint plot

Seabornâ€™s `jointplot` displays a relationship between 2 variables \(bivariate\) as well as 1D profiles \(univariate\) in the margins. The **multivariate normal distribution** is a nice tool to demonstrate this type of plot as it is sampling from a multidimensional Gaussian and there is natural clustering.

Draw a plot of two variables with bivariate and univariate graphs.
