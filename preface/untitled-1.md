# Who the book is written for

We are living in an era of information overload. Excess amounts of information are overwhelming and we are even generating data by almost every daily behavior. Big data has become a buzz word for decade, however, are we getting better at handling data or benefiting more from data?

**The answer is no.**

Despite great progress in our ability to collect and store data, we’re still very weak in interpreting data. In 1954, Darrell Huff wrote his best-selling book about how people often intentionally use graphs to spread misinformation, especially in favor of their own products or causes. Today, vastly more misinformation is disseminated unintentionally because people don’t know how to use charts to communicate what they intend.
