**“Crash Visualization”** is supposed to help you improve data visualization and storytelling skills – mainly through practical cases and programming. There are learning materials in each session, from the statistical concepts to build powerful data applications.

The book is open source and free. With the donation, you are helping me a lot to finance this book. That way I can invest more time in producing good content continuously.
